WebDriver Waiting Methods
------------------------------------------

wait commands
------------------------------------------

Thread.sleep()

1) implicit wait
2) explicit wait/ fluent wait



NoSuchElementException  -  Element is not present on the webpage(also Synchronization problem)
ElementNotFoundException  -  Locators is incorrect


sleep()
-----------------------
Advantage
    1) easy to use
DisAdvantages
    1) if the time is not sufficient then you will get exception
    2) it will wait for maximum time out, this will reduce the performance
    3) multiple times


implicit wait
------------------------
Syntax
    driver.manage().timeouts().implicitWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10))

Advantages
    1) single time/ one statement
    2) It will not wait till maximum time if the element is available
    3) Application for all the elements
    4) easy to use
Disadvantages
    1) If the time is not sufficient then you will get exception




explicit wait
----------------------

1) Conditional based, it will work more effectively
2) finding element is inclusive(for some conditions)
3) it will wait for condition to be true, then consider the time
4) we need to write multiple statement for multiple elements
